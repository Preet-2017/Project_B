the car and no one can get me out and everyone is standing around looking at me but no one is helping and i'm screaming and in pain. i find that little things startle me so much and i've forgotten so many details of what happened even though i was conscious for the whole event. i'm getting so angry because everyone i reach out to for help seems to think i'm just absolutely fantastic because my physical injuries have healed and everyone keeps telling me i'm lucky.but i don't feel it. i feel so stressed and anxious i won't let anyone else in my car because i'm afraid i'll hurt them and i spend hours staring at the pictures of the accident trying to undo it or punish myself for what i've done. i've always been anxious but this is a whole new level and i'm having panic attacks literally

having a panic attack.i have two children of my own and have never been in danger.i did lose a very close friend because of one of my panic attacks.she just didnt understand.i think your child is perfectly safe with you.i am sure you are a teriffic mother. || missbenthos: hi maq, what kind of response do you usually have during a panic attack? for myself i would never hurt anyone physically, i can sometimes have an overwhelming anger but i never go into a blind rage where i do regretful things. || blondguy: hi maq no you cant (unless there are other psychological issues happening) you mentioned above that your husband has concerns about your ability to care for your toddler. i used have awful anxiety attacks for a few years and anger isnt one of the symptoms. just my humble opinion if thats ok.i would ask your gp the same question as your thread topic maq can i ask if you have a gp that you can talk to? you have everything to gain and nothing to lose by doing so.especially if you print out this thread excellent thread you have written and hand it to them any questions are always welcome maq my kind thoughts paul || step_twelve: dear maq, i almost feel insulted on your behalf! people's lack of understanding can be particularly hurtful when it demeans us (unintentionally or not). perhaps you need give your husband a pamphlet or two about understanding and supporting someone with anxiety. there are some available on this website. they're simple to understand and there's really no excuse for ignorance about the condition once you've been provided with good quality information. regarding the safety of your toddler, think of it this way: anxiety is essentially hyper-vigilance; it's your brain's protection mechanism going into overdrive. you become highly alert and sensitive to all possible threats around you (even ones that don't exist). during a panic attack, adrenaline is released - known as the superhuman hormone that makes us temporarily better, stronger, faster. all of your senses become heightened, you're primed and ready to respond to any threat or crisis. does this hyper-vigilant state seem like it would be dangerous for anyone around you? no, you're probably the safest, most capable person in the room! sometimes, this hyper-vigilance manifests in thoughts of hurting someone or ourselves. i don't know if you're dealing with this, but many people do, and it's simply our brain telling us not to do the things we're thinking of (usually weird and random things that anxiety invents). as far as anxiety is concerned, there is absolutely no danger of acting on these thoughts in a way that would harm anyone. i hope the frustration you're feeling doesn't stop you from having a wonderful christmas break with your friends and family. take care, and merry christmas! || white_rose: dear maq hello and welcome to the forum. you have certainly stirred up a hornet's nest with your post and rightfully so. well done. have a look at the information available on this site. look under the facts at the top of the page. there is some information about panic which you can download and show your husband. there is also a booklet written especially for family and friends about depression etc. you will need to ask beyondblue to send this to you. no charge. like all those who have already replied i have gone through panic attacks. it's definitely not nice but does not make you a threat to others. far from it as step twelve has explained. may i suggest you settle this question with your husband as quickly as possible. i would hate to think he gives your child the idea that you are not a safe person to be around. and this can happen without necessarily any intention. in fact being with your toddler can be a distraction from the panic and help you recover more quickly. go to your gp or counsellor and talk about this. in fact it would be a good idea to take your husband to your next session with your gp and/or counsellor. this needs to be understood early before it becomes an issue or is so firmly stuck in your husband's head that he will not change his ideas. mary || romantic_thi3f: hi maq, welcome to the forums and thank you for reaching out. i can see that you've already gotten some great replies already but i just wanted to add to it anyway. when we have a panic attack, our mind enters a flight/fight response. there are so many things that can happen in our body and so many things we may feel; mostly fear - although i'm not sure what else you might have experienced personally. sometimes, we can also experience really intense anger too. everyone experiences a panic attack differently. but there is a significant difference between feeling intense anger and acting on intense anger. i can tell by your post that you care very deeply about your loved ones. while i don't know you at all, i have no doubt in my mind that your toddler is completely safe with you. while i'm not a mother myself, i know that being a mother with anxiety (or an anxiety disorder) can be overwhelming and probably have its moments, but again, it does not at all make you a bad mother. i hope that this, as well as all of the other posts - gives you lots of reassurance. feel free to reach out again if you like. rt || calmseeker: hi maq and everyone, personally, i couldn't see how on earth you would be of any threat to your child during your panic episodes. for me, i am incapable of doing much at all during an episode, i am busy scrambling to ground myself and trying to tell myself i am not going crazy, and trying to breath deeply. i think your husbands 'suggestion' that you are of danger to your child has struck a chord with you whilst you are in such a vulnerable state. years ago, my child's father, now my ex, told me during a panic episode that i couldn't handle life and i was becoming useless. not what i needed to hear! the sentence really got stuck in my head and tortured me for quite some time until i unpacked his comment and realised he was talking about himself, not about me. nonetheless, it was a cruel thing to say to someone who was not well at the time. the fact that you are even concerned about your child's safety speaks volumes to the kind of mum you are. without knowing you i would take a guess that you are a great mother. sending you best wishes and calm thoughts. cs\",\n          \"hey mm8kids, omg you need a medal - 8 kids is amazing . sorry thought that hubby is less than supportive at the moment and telling you , \\\" to get over it\\\" is not helpful at all time to get out of the house and see your gp at least. the pain from caesarean is enough to deal with let alone a hysterectomy as well. 10 weeks is a long time to still be in such pain and no wonder as rest would be impossible with 8 kids. any family support available to help you out and give you a break ? maybe hubby could spring for a housekeeper, or baby sitter for a while to help out . like you said buying whatever they want is not the answer. how old is your eldest ? do all the kids have their own jobs to do to help you out ? not sure about services in you area but if you go see your gp i'm sure they maybe able to suggest some support through local community or church groups please keep in touch and let us know how you are going stressless || blue_jane: hi there firstly, congratulations on the birth of your daughter. she sounds wonderful. i agree with the suggestions which stressless makes above. especially the point around seeing your gp. it might be helpful if your husband hears what you are going to say/have shared with your gp. do you feel comfortable doing this? have you spoken to him about being more understanding and working together as a team? i can only imagine that having a big family relies on organisation and communication and it sounds like he could be doing more. do you already thank him for doing little things? does he respond to the recognition? i look forward to hearing from you. blue jane\",\n          \"dear rach93.hello, the jerks your talking about i think are called myoclonic, twitches and jerks, and can be caused by anxiety.i got them with my medication, and my dr. said they are harmless but in saying that please check your symptoms with your gp.to be certain. during a bout of anxiety our muscles tense up sometimes causing these jerks.i deep breathe counting my breaths in and out.to help relax my muscles.or i might play a song i like to sing along with. its finding what works for you to relax your body, muscles and mind.the more i used to think about them and kind of put my thoughts onto feeling my body.the more i got. maybe some type of meditation or mindfulness might also help. have you spoken to your gp about these jerks?.if not i would like to very gently encourage you to do so. here if you feel to talk. my kindest thoughts dear rach. grandy. || megan90: hi there, i have been having body jerks when resting, especially when laying down at night with or without feeling stressed in the moment. i definitely suffer with health anxiety and have got a few years now. i get them often and they re scary! i m going to ask my doctor today. i know this post is old, but if you see this reply then i would love to speak to you! || mark z.: hi rach93, i'm sorry for your challenge. i had similar experience. i used to think i was seriously ill, i self-diagnosed and felt that some of the symptoms were very similar. i fell into deep anxiety, couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, and couldn't calmly work, study, or pursue any hobbies. my physical condition gradually deteriorated, which made me more suspicious that i was sick, and i wanted to go into deeper anxiety, which was a vicious circle. i didn't have the courage to go to the doctor and say what i really think, i didn't have the courage to get tested, i didn't have the courage to share it with anyone especially my family. until one day i couldn't stand my state and decided to face any outcome and prepared for the worst. guess what? god made a joke with me, i've been completely frightening myself for the past two years. i sometimes think that maybe in another parallel world, my test results are the worst, and i do have the disease i suspect. but even so, i don't regret my decision to see a doctor or get a test, otherwise the nightmare would never end. hope it helps a bit. hope everything will be fine.mark || sbella02: rach93, thank you for utilising the forums, we warmly welcome you. i definitely relate, i think it might've been my ex partner who mentioned it to me a while back that there would be times when i'd suddenly twitch or jerk my head as if i was shivering in cold weather. sudden jerks or twitches can have something to do with feeling anxious, but it may also be worth mentioning to your gp if these jerking movements are causing you significant distress. they may be able to offer you further information about what this means - whether it's related to anxiety or otherwise. i hope this advice is helpful, and please remember that we're always here to chat if you need. sb\"\n

'who am i really? why am i here? what's my purpose? what really brings me joy? why am i suffering/struggling so much?' and stuff along those lines. i've found it pays to develop a curious or wonderful (wonder filled) tone, rather than a depressing one. i know, easier said than done at times but i find a depressing tone tends to lead me deeper and deeper into that dark well known as depression. if the call is to raise ourself, rather than sink further into that well, the question becomes 'how the heck do i raise myself?'. depending on how far in or down we are, we could add to that 'when i've never felt myself this low before'. when people mention 'energy levels', this is not always as straight forward as some might imagine. there's physical energy, which can involve every energy system in our body (vascular system, endocrine system, nervous system, muscular system etc) and all the chemical energy that interacts with such systems. then there's mental energy which can involve the energy of our belief systems, inner dialogue and more. and lastly there's what you could call natural energy or a soulful kind of energy. combining all 3 aspects, so as to offer an example, you could say 'the people pleaser in me insists i please everyone but myself (mental energy)and this is not really all that good for dopamine production (physical/chemical energy). i just can't sense all that much life running through me and it feels soul destroying (a basic or natural sense of energy)'. while i happily admit to being a bit of a 'woo woo' gal , i also appreciate the sciences. quantum physics points to the nature of energy, including how it's expressed and experienced. if there's not enough of it, if energy's not excited enough, we can't feel any great excitement. we're designed to feel energy in motion (e-motion) and when there's a lack of it. 'what chemistry is going to excite me and every cell in my body? what new facet of myself, which there's a need to develop, can get me excited? what soulful or natural elements in life are going to excite me?' can be questions leading to exploring a truly fascinating rabbit hole packed with inspiration, revelations and possibilities. || tombo67: i know how you feel and i am in a similar position at a similar age. i know that i need to make a change but i don t know what change to make or how to get there, after being in a long-term marriage and losing two of my children to parental alienation during the divorce it left me disconnected and depressed. i took shelter in my work and now the industry is changing so rapidly and is now run by people half my age and i am finding it hard to get past that and continue so i am looking for something new but not finding it. i m living in a constant state of anxiety and fear because i feel like i have so much time left in life but not enough resources or energy to sustain myself. i too have found a new partner who is wonderful and supportive but i cannot share these deep dark feelings with her.i understand you may have been looking for advice and i wish i could give you some but perhaps it may give you some peace to know that you are not alone. || tombo67: it looks like you are able to turn this difficult situation into a positive and i applaud that. i will do my best to approach things with curiosity rather than depression or anxiety however it may take a bit of work to get there. i must admit that what you wrote has inspired and uplifted me a bit during a difficult time. thank you very much for your contribution || annas1: hello to all, and i agree tombo67, tr has offered a really hopeful and rich way to address this mid-life challenge we face. in some ways, i see it as my personal reckoning, i.e. a clarion call to change up the way i value myself, my relationships and my opportunities in life. it is a long and pretty rugged process, i have found. but one that does make sense to me even when i'm suffering from the stress and angst that result from clinging on to my old ways of trying to be me. i've heard it from a few different sources now, the prompt to 'let go of who you think you are/need to be, and become who you are'. this resonates so deeply for me as i now recognise that i have developed a pretty sophisticated routine in performing 'myself' for others. it is painful to change this habit, will my relationships survive me dropping the 'act'? it brings up such a lot of fear and shame. so, this is where my work is - to challenge the shame that tries to convince me i'm not okay being my true, simple self and drawing on my courage to show up in the world without the pleasing and performing. for me, the first task has been to acknowledge the gap between who i present as in my relationships and who are really am. because although i fear to be seen for the real 'me', it is also what i most desire. and the act i have learned to perform is tiring. i wonder if this is some of what you are feeling too? part of the reason why this process is happening now for me, in mid-life, is that i have the resources to deal with it. i have worked on building my inner awareness and really reflecting on my values. i have sought the support of kindly comrades along the way and gained much from psychotherapy. and yet it is still really hard. i can go through extended periods of insomnnia, physical distress and mental anguish when triggered by particular life challenges or relationship interactions. i can get completely off-course from my 'project' and forget all the good work i've done on reclaiming the person i was meant to be. the shame and the guilt and the alienation can sneak back into to my experience and i can feel like i'm back at the beginning again. adrift and bereft. so then it's a matter of dusting myself off, remembering why i'm feeling the way i am - usually i haven't honoured my needs - and start with small steps in prioritising my values and connecting with key people. and another great piece of advice i have received - believe in yourself, it's your number one task. go well || therising: hi annas1 the amount of times i've asked myself 'why can i not pass this test (being my most authentic self) with this particular person or these people?' i've lost count of. they're typically people i've known my whole life. so, i suppose you could say it's about trying to break the habit of a lifetime. it's about avoiding being degraded in some way, being declared in one way or another as being worth less or worthless. i give the sage in me full credit regarding the following wisdom 'shouldn't you have the attitude towards others of 'bring it on. give it your best shot. come on, grade me how you will and watch as your words become nothing more than water off a duck's back''. we might need to ruffle our feathers a bit now and then, to avoid anything sinking in, but learning how to let things slide right off us means inviting that which tests us. while this sounds good in theory, practice is a whole other thing. practice, practice, practice makes us confident practitioners of being our most authentic self. if we don't practice being ourself how do we hope to become masters of who we are? our greatest supporters can definitely make such a difference. while my mum was my greatest supporter and used to insist i remain true to myself and be proud of who i am, she passed away five and a half weeks ago. now i am being tested without her here. now i find myself fighting with people or no longer tolerating certain behaviours, which is liberating in a sense. in the past, i would go to my mum feeling wounded. while i used to surrender parts of myself and seek reassurance (after insults or degradation), now i find myself becoming more so a warrior princess who's prepared to fight the good fight, the fight to remain true to myself. in my mind and heart, the full support of my mum remains. in the process of us developing a truly brilliant nature, i believe we need to decide whether it's a nature worth fighting for, as opposed to a nature to be sacrificed in order to please others. why would we not fight for what we truly love about ourself? and while we may earn a few labels in the process, such as 'difficult', 'inflexible' and some other very colourful labels, let us not call them labels. we shall call them 'badges of honour' and wear them proudly as we honour ourself and what we stand for. cheers to being upstanding.\\n\\n[SENTIMENT: POSITIVE || NEUTRAL || NEGATIVE || POSITIVE || POSITIVE || NEUTRAL]\",\n          \"POST:\\nand it was entirely my own fault. i tried crossing two lanes of traffic on a street that i've done it a million times before. it was really busy and a guy opened up a gap for me. i was so focussed on missing an accident in those later lanes that i forgot for an instant to double check the closest ones which seemed completely clear. noone was hurt, and there was only really minor damage to the cars. i just didn't see him. the insurance has accepted all claims but i'm still so wrecked with guilt over the situation. i'm so ashamed that i can't bring myself to tell anyone. i'm so scared to get back in the car because i'm paranoid that i'll miss something somehow. and i'm so scared that this is going to become one of those things that just stays with me for years and years to come. i have had major issues with guilt / shame anxiety in the past. it's partially the lack of personal concequence that's really messing with me. everything ended so neatly and almost too well. i am thankful for this but at the same time i feel as though i should have been fined, punished somehow. on the one hand i feel as though i deserve to have this anxiety, but i don't know how to stop feeling this way, and i really don't think i can handle dwelling on this kind of shame again for as long as i did last time.\\n\\nCOMMENTS:\\nhi grovi. i'm so sorry for you with having had an accident. not sure of your age or driving experience, but when it comes to accidents, particularly driving accidents, no-one is exempt. even the most experienced driver with 100's of hours experience can make a slip-up. the good thing is, no-one was seriously hurt, no-one was killed. a suggestion here, what you could think about doing, contact a reputable driving school. explain what happened and how. ask if it's possible for one of their instructors to help you return to driving. when the instructor comes, tell him about your fear of getting back behind the wheel. ask if it's possible for them to take you out in your own car. most instructors are schooled in helping first time drivers, you could just about put yourself in this category. it is important you get back into the car a.s.a.p. like falling off a horse or anything. the first thing you do is get back in the race. the longer you put it off, the harder it's going to get. lynda. || dwwmills: hello grovi. i think the short answer is that you have to except that you re human and forgive yourself for making a mistake. you said that you deserve to have this anxiety, should have been fined or punished somehow. i think you re holding yourself to a standard which is completely unrealistic. i don t think anyone else would hold you to this standard and i suspect you wouldn t hold anyone else to it either. you had an accident not an i did it on purpose or an i am irresponsible and need to be punished . we make mistakes all day long yours just happened to be at a time where it had consequences. no one was hurt so that s fantastic. that said i m not trying to minimise the fright and how unnerving it can be to be involved in an accident. your confidence may take a hit for a little while and pipsy s idea of getting a driving instructor if you are finding it difficult to get back on the road is a great idea. be kind to yourself as you would be to someone else in the same situation. you deserve that. give it a little bit of time and you will feel much better i m sure. no one is perfect. dean || mummybee: hi grovi, i understand how you feel about \\\"worring that ill miss something somehow\\\". sometimes something like a car accident or when you forget to do something really important you lose a bit of faith in yourself. things you have always done on auto pilot (like driving) becomes something scary because you fear you have lost the ability to do it properly and safely anymore. this is of course untrue, but the anxious mind, or even those without anxiety can feel this way after your kind of experience. i think its normal. as far as what to do to get past it? i would suggest getting back on the horse. of course you will be more aware and tuned in to what youre doing for a while, but that will settle with time. you will soon be driving again on auto pilot, as safely as ever. people make mistakes, little ones, big ones. its what makes us human. the way we go forward from there tells more about our skills in life than the mistakes we make. mummybee || hussyawan1122: i'm really sorry you're feeling this way, but please remember that accidents happen, and you ve already done the right thing by addressing it with insurance. it s completely normal to feel guilty, but it's important to be kind to yourself. you've learned from the situation, and everything ended as well as it could. if you're struggling with the anxiety, it might help to talk to a professional to work through those feelings. for the car damage, a smash repair shop can help get your vehicle back in shape. don t be too hard on yourself you're human, and mistakes happen. || guest_727765: hey, i just want to say first thank you for being honest and sharing this. it takes a lot of courage to admit fault, especially when you're feeling guilt and anxiety on top of everything. the truth is, even the most careful drivers can make a mistake, especially in high-pressure traffic situations like the one you described. you were trying to be safe, and it was a momentary lapse it doesn t make you a bad person or a careless driver. the fact that no one was hurt and the damage was minor is something to be incredibly thankful for, even if it doesn t take the weight off your shoulders right now. feeling guilt when something goes wrong is human, but punishing yourself over and over isn t going to help you or anyone else. accidents happen what matters is that you care, you re owning up to it, and you're learning from it. that already puts you ahead of so many others who would brush it off or make excuses. if it helps at all, maybe taking care of the repairs and seeing your car restored can be part of your recovery. a good smash repair shop can help you get everything back to perfect, and maybe that physical reset can help with the mental one too. and please don t be afraid to talk to someone about the anxiety side guilt shouldn t be something you carry alone or for years. be kind to yourself you re already doing more than enough by acknowledging it and wanting to do better. you've got this.\\n\\n[SENTIMENT: NEGATIVE || NEGATIVE || NEGATIVE || NEUTRAL || NEUTRAL]\",\n          \"POST:\\ni am international student to tasmania in 2021 and have been working hard to get my permanent residency, which i m nominated for and expect to receive in january 2026. i m 30 now and working as an auditor, but i m really unhappy in my job.i ve been with my company for two years. the first year was okay because auditing was new to me, and i was learning. but in my second year, i have to manage my own clients, which involves calling them and handling their accounts. i really dislike making phone calls (which my senior, manager and partner prefers me to do), and i struggle to understand clients backgrounds, which makes completing audits harder because of the language, sometime they just speaking too much information and i dont get it. i also feel stressed managing first-year graduates who question me a lot, and it makes me feel disrespected and less confident. honestly, i just want to get the job done, but i know i need to engage more with clients to do it well.on top of that, i m studying for my ca qualification, which my company sponsors. i ve completed four subjects, but i don t understand much of what i ve studied, and i m not interested in it. i ve been in accounting since i was 17, but now at 30, i realize it s not what i enjoy. the problem is, i don t know what i do enjoy or what else i could do. i feel like i should finish the ca since i m so close just one more year but it s making me more stressed and unhappy. i m worried that at 30, i don t have many chances to start over, and i don t want to waste the effort i ve put in.i also feel very alone here. i don t have close friends in tasmania to talk to about these deep thoughts, and i feel like no one really understands me. once i have made some real friend, they left and moved to other state for some reason, which makes me feel even more hard to makes friend as they come and go. i m torn between quitting my job to find something that makes me happier and sticking it out for the ca and my pr.\\n\\nCOMMENTS:\\nhello tevont, sometimes it can feel like everything is going wrong when one thing goes wrong but there is a way out. have you tried to contact your country's community club?

i can highly recommend beyond blue webchat, there is always someone to talk to 24/7.be kind to yourself.wishybee || therising: the warmest of welcomes to you at such an incredibly challenging time in your life, on so many levels. i think 'i just don't know how to do life' can be a fair and understandable statement to make at times. as a 54yo gal, i've found myself thinking this on occasion over the years. when it gets to mid life or the mid-ish point, a lot of people can fob it off as 'he's/she's going through some mid life crisis'. personally, i've found it's more about a crisis of identity and it happens for good reason. with a crisis of identity, it can be along the lines of how we identify ourself, ourself in relation to life in general, the people around us, our environment and so much more. a lot of life's philosophical questions can start pouring in and depending on how we ask the questions, whether it be with a curious tone or a depressing tone, there remains the need to find the answers. 'who am i really? why am i here? what's my purpose? what really brings me joy? why am i suffering/struggling so much?' and stuff along those lines. i've found it pays to develop a curious or wonderful (wonder filled) tone, rather than a depressing one. i know, easier said than done at times but i find a depressing tone tends to lead me deeper and deeper into that dark well known as depression. if the call is to raise ourself, rather than sink further into that well, the question becomes 'how the heck do i raise myself?'. depending on how far in or down we are, we could add to that 'when i've never felt myself this low before'. when people mention 'energy levels', this is not always as straight forward as some might imagine. there's physical energy, which can involve every energy system in our body (vascular system, endocrine system, nervous system, muscular system etc) and all the chemical energy that interacts with such systems. then there's mental energy which can involve the energy of our belief systems, inner dialogue and more. and lastly there's what you could call natural energy or a soulful kind of energy. combining all 3 aspects, so as to offer an example, you could say 'the people pleaser in me insists i please everyone but myself (mental energy)and this is not really all that good for dopamine production (physical/chemical energy). i just can't sense all that much life running through me and it feels soul destroying (a basic or natural sense of energy)'. while i happily admit to being a bit of a 'woo woo' gal , i also appreciate the sciences. quantum physics points to the nature of energy, including how it's expressed and experienced. if there's not enough of it, if energy's not excited enough, we can't feel any great excitement. we're designed to feel energy in motion (e-motion) and when there's a lack of it. 'what chemistry is going to excite me and every cell in my body? what new facet of myself, which there's a need to develop, can get me excited? what soulful or natural elements in life are going to excite me?' can be questions leading to exploring a truly fascinating rabbit hole packed with inspiration, revelations and possibilities. || tombo67: i know how you feel and i am in a similar position at a similar age. i know that i need to make a change but i don t know what change to make or how to get there, after being in a long-term marriage and losing two of my children to parental alienation during the divorce it left me disconnected and depressed. i took shelter in my work and now the industry is changing so rapidly and is now run by people half my age and i am finding it hard to get past that and continue so i am looking for something new but not finding it. i m living in a constant state of anxiety and fear because i feel like i have so much time left in life but not enough resources or energy to sustain myself. i too have found a new partner who is wonderful and supportive but i cannot share these deep dark feelings with her.i understand you may have been looking for advice and i wish i could give you some but perhaps it may give you some peace to know that you are not alone. || tombo67: it looks like you are able to turn this difficult situation into a positive and i applaud that. i will do my best to approach things with curiosity rather than depression or anxiety however it may take a bit of work to get there. i must admit that what you wrote has inspired and uplifted me a bit during a difficult time. thank you very much for your contribution || annas1: hello to all, and i agree tombo67, tr has offered a really hopeful and rich way to address this mid-life challenge we face. in some ways, i see it as my personal reckoning, i.e. a clarion call to change up the way i value myself, my relationships and my opportunities in life. it is a long and pretty rugged process, i have found. but one that does make sense to me even when i'm suffering from the stress and angst that result from clinging on to my old ways of trying to be me. i've heard it from a few different sources now, the prompt to 'let go of who you think you are/need to be, and become who you are'. this resonates so deeply for me as i now recognise that i have developed a pretty sophisticated routine in performing 'myself' for others. it is painful to change this habit, will my relationships survive me dropping the 'act'? it brings up such a lot of fear and shame. so, this is where my work is - to challenge the shame that tries to convince me i'm not okay being my true, simple self and drawing on my courage to show up in the world without the pleasing and performing. for me, the first task has been to acknowledge the gap between who i present as in my relationships and who are really am. because although i fear to be seen for the real 'me', it is also what i most desire. and the act i have learned to perform is tiring. i wonder if this is some of what you are feeling too? part of the reason why this process is happening now for me, in mid-life, is that i have the resources to deal with it. i have worked on building my inner awareness and really reflecting on my values. i have sought the support of kindly comrades along the way and gained much from psychotherapy. and yet it is still really hard. i can go through extended periods of insomnnia, physical distress and mental anguish when triggered by particular life challenges or relationship interactions. i can get completely off-course from my 'project' and forget all the good work i've done on reclaiming the person i was meant to be. the shame and the guilt and the alienation can sneak back into to my experience and i can feel like i'm back at the beginning again. adrift and bereft. so then it's a matter of dusting myself off, remembering why i'm feeling the way i am - usually i haven't honoured my needs - and start with small steps in prioritising my values and connecting with key people. and another great piece of advice i have received - believe in yourself, it's your number one task. go well || therising: hi annas1 the amount of times i've asked myself 'why can i not pass this test (being my most authentic self) with this particular person or these people?' i've lost count of. they're typically people i've known my whole life. so, i suppose you could say it's about trying to break the habit of a lifetime. it's about avoiding being degraded in some way, being declared in one way or another as being worth less or worthless. i give the sage in me full credit regarding the following wisdom 'shouldn't you have the attitude towards others of 'bring it on. give it your best shot. come on, grade me how you will and watch as your words become nothing more than water off a duck's back''. we might need to ruffle our feathers a bit now and then, to avoid anything sinking in, but learning how to let things slide right off us means inviting that which tests us. while this sounds good in theory, practice is a whole other thing. practice, practice, practice makes us confident practitioners of being our most authentic self. if we don't practice being ourself how do we hope to become masters of who we are? our greatest supporters can definitely make such a difference. while my mum was my greatest supporter and used to insist i remain true to myself and be proud of who i am, she passed away five and a half weeks ago. now i am being tested without her here. now i find myself fighting with people or no longer tolerating certain behaviours, which is liberating in a sense. in the past, i would go to my mum feeling wounded. while i used to surrender parts of myself and seek reassurance (after insults or degradation), now i find myself becoming more so a warrior princess who's prepared to fight the good fight, the fight to remain true to myself. in my mind and heart, the full support of my mum remains. in the process of us developing a truly brilliant nature, i believe we need to decide whether it's a nature worth fighting for, as opposed to a nature to be sacrificed in order to please others. why would we not fight for what we truly love about ourself? and while we may earn a few labels in the process, such as 'difficult', 'inflexible' and some other very colourful labels, let us not call them labels. we shall call them 'badges of honour' and wear them proudly as we honour ourself and what we stand for. cheers to being upstanding.\",\n          \"hi grovi. i'm so sorry for you with having had an accident. not sure of your age or driving experience, but when it comes to accidents, particularly driving accidents, no-one is exempt. even the most experienced driver with 100's of hours experience can make a slip-up. the good thing is, no-one was seriously hurt, no-one was killed. a suggestion here, what you could think about doing, contact a reputable driving school. explain what happened and how. ask if it's possible for one of their instructors to help you return to driving. when the instructor comes, tell him about your fear of getting back behind the wheel. ask if it's possible for them to take you out in your own car. most instructors are schooled in helping first time drivers, you could just about put yourself in this category. it is important you get back into the car a.s.a.p. like falling off a horse or anything. the first thing you do is get back in the race. the longer you put it off, the harder it's going to get. lynda. || dwwmills: hello grovi. i think the short answer is that you have to except that you re human and forgive yourself for making a mistake. you said that you deserve to have this anxiety, should have been fined or punished somehow. i think you re holding yourself to a standard which is completely unrealistic. i don t think anyone else would hold you to this standard and i suspect you wouldn t hold anyone else to it either. you had an accident not an i did it on purpose or an i am irresponsible and need to be punished . we make mistakes all day long yours just happened to be at a time where it had consequences. no one was hurt so that s fantastic. that said i m not trying to minimise the fright and how unnerving it can be to be involved in an accident. your confidence may take a hit for a little while and pipsy s idea of getting a driving instructor if you are finding it difficult to get back on the road is a great idea. be kind to yourself as you would be to someone else in the same situation. you deserve that. give it a little bit of time and you will feel much better i m sure. no one is perfect. dean || mummybee: hi grovi, i understand how you feel about \\\"worring that ill miss something somehow\\\". sometimes something like a car accident or when you forget to do something really important you lose a bit of faith in yourself. things you have always done on auto pilot (like driving) becomes something scary because you fear you have lost the ability to do it properly and safely anymore. this is of course untrue, but the anxious mind, or even those without anxiety can feel this way after your kind of experience. i think its normal. as far as what to do to get past it? i would suggest getting back on the horse. of course you will be more aware and tuned in to what youre doing for a while, but that will settle with time. you will soon be driving again on auto pilot, as safely as ever. people make mistakes, little ones, big ones. its what makes us human. the way we go forward from there tells more about our skills in life than the mistakes we make. mummybee || hussyawan1122: i'm really sorry you're feeling this way, but please remember that accidents happen, and you ve already done the right thing by addressing it with insurance. it s completely normal to feel guilty, but it's important to be kind to yourself. you've learned from the situation, and everything ended as well as it could. if you're struggling with the anxiety, it might help to talk to a professional to work through those feelings. for the car damage, a smash repair shop can help get your vehicle back in shape. don t be too hard on yourself you're human, and mistakes happen. || guest_727765: hey, i just want to say first thank you for being honest and sharing this. it takes a lot of courage to admit fault, especially when you're feeling guilt and anxiety on top of everything. the truth is, even the most careful drivers can make a mistake, especially in high-pressure traffic situations like the one you described. you were trying to be safe, and it was a momentary lapse it doesn t make you a bad person or a careless driver. the fact that no one was hurt and the damage was minor is something to be incredibly thankful for, even if it doesn t take the weight off your shoulders right now. feeling guilt when something goes wrong is human, but punishing yourself over and over isn t going to help you or anyone else. accidents happen what matters is that you care, you re owning up to it, and you're learning from it. that already puts you ahead of so many others who would brush it off or make excuses. if it helps at all, maybe taking care of the repairs and seeing your car restored can be part of your recovery. a good smash repair shop can help you get everything back to perfect, and maybe that physical reset can help with the mental one too. and please don t be afraid to talk to someone about the anxiety side guilt shouldn t be something you carry alone or for years. be kind to yourself you re already doing more than enough by acknowledging it and wanting to do better. you've got this.\",\n          \"hello tevont, sometimes it can feel like everything is going wrong when one thing goes wrong but there is a way out. have you tried to contact your country's community club?
